# Audit-Proof-CICD

Audit-Proof-CICD
Audit prof Change & release management Solution for Hybrid Package Solution with Compliance Centric Dash Board. Provide complete traceability & Audit info for any change detected in PROD

• Using CI/CD (Automated) User Story – Code Commit to Git ID – Build ID(Artifact ID) - Change management ID (Change request)- Deployment ID- Production Detection ID. • Without CI/CD(Manual) User Story – Code Commit to Git ID - Change management ID (Change request) - Production Detection ID

· Provide who /when/ why approve the User Story, Changes request. · Provide Change approve complete picture SDLC and Change details. · Provide who /when/ why build and Deploy the code. · Provide who /when/ how did the Application fictional, regression, Load, Security testing completed.


CI & CD Principles
                                                                                                                                                     1)Automate everything: build, test, and deployment
2)Keep everything in a source code management system (use GitHub)
3)Keep absolutely everything in a source code management system
4)Use a CI tool that integrates tightly (webhooks) with your source code repository §  Commit your code to the repository frequently
5)Don’t commit directly to a delivery branch; use a feature branch and PR workflow §  Don’t ignore failing CI tests even on feature branches
6)Don’t merge broken code to a delivery branch; it must pass the CI system first
7)Deploy the same way to every environment
8)No-downtime deployments; stateless frontend, load balancer, and sequential deployment
9)Automated feedback on the entire process
10)Use a container technology (Docker) if possible, as it makes deployment simple
11)If the process is painful, you’re doing it wrong
